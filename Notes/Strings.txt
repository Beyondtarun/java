#STRINGS ?
1. String is a non-primitive data type(means size is not fixed)
2. String is the sequence of characters.(Array of Charracters)
eg:- char [] c ={a,b,c,d,e}; //Collection CharSequence(interface) to implement the same
String S = new String(c);

3. String is a class
     
     public final class String extends Object implements CharSequence,Serializable,Comparable {
        //Serializable: interface is used when we need to store a copy of the object and send them to another process which runs on the same system or over the network.
        //Comparable: interface is used to order the objects of the class. it has only one method compareTo();
     }
     Q. Why it is final?
4. String S = new String(); // object S <- immutable object
   String S = "tarun"; // this is also a objects
   Q. Differnce b/w above methods

5. To Create Strings classes are: String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder
