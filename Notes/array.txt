ARRAYS ARE OBJECT IN JAVA

1.1-D array

#declartion: (can be declared with primitive or classname(for storing objects))

int[] a;//conventional     | int[9] a; wrong
int []a;
int a[];
int[]a;

int []a,b; //both array
int[] a,b; //both array
int a[],b; //only a array and b is int

#Creation:(giving size in compulsory)
 
a= new int[size]; //size could be ZERO but negative size can give runtime exception
int a[] = new int[size];//declaration + creation;

#Intialization: after creation default 0.
int[] a ={10,20,20,.,.};
int[] a = new int[]{10,20,20,.,.}; //do not declre size it will give error

2. 2-D ARRAY

declaration:
int[][] a;  | int[] a[],b; a is 2d b is 1d
int [][]a;  | int[] a[],b[]; both 2d
int a[][];  | int[][] a,[]b; compile time error for b // bracket before varable can be only for first;
int[] a[];
int[] []a;

creation:
 int[][] a = new int[rows][col];

Jagged array // every row has diff col;
